The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.

## Notes

I am quite sad that I do not really have time to implment the optional features because I am in the final week. The experience is really interesting because it is the first time I try to make an app on phone. I am really looking forward to improve the feature once I finish my final. The main obstcale i meet is that sometimes the gif show on the page are a little blured. Other than that, I am really looking forward to participate in the course
